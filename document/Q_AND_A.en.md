## Know-How
This section organizes solutions for problems that may occur.

### ■ Connection and disconnection repeats (red and green LEDs blink alternately)
It is likely that the connection information between the paired devices has been lost on one side, causing a mismatch.  
Delete the registered device on Windows/Mac/iPhone/Android and try pairing again.

### ■ LED does not turn red when pressing a button
If you are using the device for the first time in a while, the battery may be discharged. Charge it for about 5 minutes and check if it responds.  
If the battery still has charge, open the cover and press the Reset button (ON -> OFF).

### ■ Serial port is not recognized
While holding down the Boot button, press the Reset button (ON -> OFF).  
Starting in Bootloader mode will ensure the serial port is enabled.

### ■ Specific A, B, X, or Y button does not respond
Dust or debris may be attached to the conductive rubber. Disassemble the device and clean the contact points.

### ■ Serial port not recognized (Part 2)
Please try using a different Type-C cable.  
Make sure it is not a charging-only cable, but one that supports data communication.
